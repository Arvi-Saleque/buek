  academic programs, or institutional information. Updating content required technical staff.

Solution:
  Built a complete CMS-style website with a WYSIWYG admin panel. Staff can manage every
  page, section, image, and piece of content through a protected dashboard. The public site
  is fast, SEO-ready, and mobile-responsive.

Tech Stack:
  Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, Cloudinary, jose (JWT),

Challenges:
  - Designing an admin panel simple enough for non-technical university staff
  - Handling large media uploads (30MB+) through Next.js Server Actions
  - Building flexible data models that support all page types within a single MongoDB schema
